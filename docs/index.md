# Overview

This is the documentation for the Virtual Kubernetes Platform (VKP).

It is built around the VCluster resource, using Custom Resource Definitions to store platform configuration.

You can learn more about using VCluster in the official [VCluster documentation](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/what-are-virtual-clusters).
